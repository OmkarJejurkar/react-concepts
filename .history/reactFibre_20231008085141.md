# React Fibre and Reconciliation

React Fiber is algorithm developed by react team to reimplement the core working of the Virtual DOM. The **React Fiber** architecture makes the rendering process  of the web pages in more optimised way. React fibre architecture updates the UI in incremental manner and in chunks which makes the rendering process smooth.

## React Fiber Features
1. React fiber includes features like ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates appear.
2. Updates can be assigned a priority which helps the rendering process to display only that elements that are to be displayed first.


# Reconcilliation
Algorithim that react uses to differentiate with one tree to another to determine which parts of the UI to be changed. 

Reconcilliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly known as "Virtual DOM"
When you start your react application for rendering a tree like structure is generated and saved in memory. When there is a update in the user interface like setState method a new tree is generated and diffed with the previous trees to analyze which parts of the UI are to be updated.
